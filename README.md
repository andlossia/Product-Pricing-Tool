## Overview

The Dynamic Product Pricing & Catalog Sync Tool is a centralized, browser-based platform for D2C business owners. It allows you to manage products, pricing, and multi-channel synchronization from a single hub.

The tool feels intelligent even without AI because of its advanced rules, pseudo-AI recommendations, scenario simulations, and interactive dashboards.

It supports multiple sales channels—marketplaces, personal websites, offline stores, and delivery apps—and ensures prices are optimized, consistent, and easy to update.

* * *

## 1\. Centralized Product Catalog

*   Single Source of Truth: Add products once with all details.  
      
    
*   Product Attributes: SKU, description, images, weight, size, pages, variants (color, size, edition).  
      
    
*   Categorization & Tags: Easy filtering, searching, and organization.  
      
    
*   Bulk Updates: Edit prices, attributes, or availability for multiple products at once.  
      
    
*   Version Control: Keep historical versions and revert if needed.  
      
    

* * *

## 2\. Multi-Platform Synchronization

*   API-Based Integration: Connect to marketplaces, D2C websites, mobile apps, delivery platforms, and offline POS systems.  
      
    
*   Two-Way Sync: Changes in any channel reflect in the central catalog automatically.  
      
    
*   Conflict Resolution: Notifications for conflicting updates with easy resolution options.  
      
    
*   Audit Logs: Full record of all changes, updates, and sync events.  
      
    

* * *

## 3\. Advanced Product Search & Matching

*   Textual Matching: Identify products with ≥3 common words in title/description.  
      
    
*   Numeric Matching: ±10% tolerance for weight, size, price, or other numeric attributes.  
      
    
*   Composite Search Rules: Combine multiple conditions with OR/AND logic.  
      
    
*   Filters & Sorting: Search by category, price, stock, margin, or competitor.  
      
    
*   Pseudo-AI Suggestions: Recommend similar or alternative products to users.  
      
    
*   Future Vector Search: Optional integration for precise similarity-based search.  
      
    

* * *

## 4\. Dynamic Pricing Engine (Rules-Based)

*   Base Price Calculation: Cost + Category Margin  
      
    
*   Pricing Strategies:  
      
    

*   Uniform Price: Same price across all channels  
      
    
*   Dynamic Price per Channel:  
      
    

1.  Channel Multiplier  
      
    
2.  Competitive Comparison (Text + Numeric)  
      
    
3.  Composite Method (Multiplier + Market)  
      
    

*   Rounding & Fine Adjustments: Nearest integer, multiple of 5/10, manual tweaks (-0.5, -1).  
      
    
*   Scenario Simulation: Instantly visualize effects of changes across all channels.  
      
    
*   Pseudo-Intelligence: Recommendations with rationale for a “smart” feel.  
      
    

* * *

## 5\. Tax Management

*   Tax Rate Setup: Define tax once per product in the database.  
      
    
*   Cost Inclusion Option: Specify if the product cost already includes tax.  
      
    
*   Final Price Control: Decide whether the final price per channel includes or excludes tax.  
      
    
*   Automatic Calculation: Applies tax on top of adjusted/final price when needed.  
      
    
*   Dashboard Display: Base price, adjustments, tax applied, and final price per channel.  
      
    

* * *

## 6\. Dashboard & Visual Insights

*   Multi-Channel Comparison: Base price, competitor prices, multipliers, adjustments, and final prices side-by-side.  
      
    
*   Profit Impact Visualization: Graphs showing effect of price changes on margin and profitability.  
      
    
*   Alerts & Warnings:  
      
    

*   Price below cost  
      
    
*   Price deviates from market average  
      
    
*   Low margin alerts  
      
    

*   Historical Tracking: Maintain past prices and adjustments for analysis.  
      
    
*   Scenario Analysis: Test pricing strategies and immediately see impact on all channels.

## 7\. Example Workflow

Product: Children’s Science Book

*   Cost: $100  
      
    
*   Category Margin: 35%  
      
    
*   Tax: 10% (not included in cost)  
      
    
*   Channels: Marketplace, Offline Store, Personal Website  
      
    

Steps:

1.  Base Price: $100 / (1 − 0.35) = $153.85  
      
    
2.  Market Comparison: Competitor average = $155.00  
      
    
3.  Apply Channel Multipliers:  
      
    

*   Marketplace ×1.25 → $192.31  
      
    
*   Offline ×1.15 → $176.92  
      
    

5.  Rounding & Adjustments: Round to nearest 5, subtract 0.5 → Marketplace = $192.5, Offline = $176.5  
      
    
6.  Apply Tax (10%):  
      
    

*   Marketplace = $192.5 × 1.10 = $211.75  
      
    
*   Offline = $176.5 × 1.10 = $194.15  
      
    

8.  Sync Prices: Automatically update all channels via API  
      
    
9.  Dashboard: Visual display of base price, multipliers, adjustments, tax applied, final prices, and profit estimates

Notes:

*   Tax is applied after adjustments and multipliers.  
      
    
*   Every step feeds into the next; manual edits propagate automatically.  
      
    
*   Dashboard provides pseudo-intelligence feedback to simulate AI-like recommendations.
